# NGSA-Dataset

A structured, open dataset of NGSA past papers (paper 1 question and answers), compiled for educational and non-commercial use. Includes multiple choice questions, answers, and metadata in JSON format for easy integration.

## Why I Created This

I wanted this data for a personal project, but couldn’t find it on the Ministry of Education’s website, so I built it myself. I'm sharing it so others (teachers, developers, students) can benefit too.

## File Structure

**NOTE:**
- Files labeled with ```filename-unfinished``` contain question numbers and correct answer data only. The question text, answer option labels, instruction text, and context have not yet been added.
- Files labeled with ```filename-un``` contain question numbers, correct answer data, option labels, and question texts. The instruction text and context have not yet been added.
- Files labeled with ```filename-tests``` contain test metadata such as the subject, level, paper type, and a list of references (question_ids) that point to the individual questions.
- Files labeled with ```filename-qa``` contain the individual questions for each subject range

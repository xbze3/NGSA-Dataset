As the birds flit from one object to another, \n.they look more like a bright flash of sunlight than living beings. \nBut, you ask, why are they called hummingbirds? It is because of the soft, humming noise \nmade as they rapidly flap their wings- a motion so swift, that as the birds fly, you can hardly \nsee that they have wings. \nHummingbirds place their nests so that they are very hard to find. These birds' nests are \nusually about half the size of a very small hen's egg, and are attached to a twig no thicker \nthan a steel knitting needle. They seem to be made of cotton fibres and are covered with the \nsoftest bits of leaf and bark. Hummingbirds usually lay two eggs in their nests, and each is \nabout the size of a small plum. \nOne needs to be careful when approaching the spot where a hummingbird has built its nest as \nthe female is very protective of her home. She is known to dart at unwelcomed guests and try \nto peck at their eyes. The female's sharp beak may hurt the eyes most severely, and could \neven destroy the sight. The poor little thing knows no other way of defending its young, and \ninstinct teaches it that unwelcomed guests might carry off its nest. \n\nAdapted from www.k5/earning.com. \nRetrieved 15 February 2016.

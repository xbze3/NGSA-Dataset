They were now resting and \njoking in the boat as they enjoyed their snack. \nSuddenly and without warning, Jessie's face turned shockingly pale. Her brother Owen, \nlooked at her thinking she had fallen ill. His eyes followed her gaze as she pointed to the \nstarboard side. To his horror, he saw a triangular fin above the water. Hurriedly he dashed \nto the back of the boat and tried desperately to start the motor. However, it was stuck. \nThe siblings panicked. They did not know what to do. Jessie armed herself with the oar, \npreparing to strike the monstrous beast when it attacked. Owen continued to fiddle with the \ncontrol in an effort to get the motor to start.

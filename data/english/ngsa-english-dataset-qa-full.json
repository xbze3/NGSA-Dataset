However, while some people live in fancy \nhouses and drive luxurious cars, many children are not so \nfortunate. There are those who suffer from malnutrition since \nthe only food they have to eat is what they get out of garbage \nbins. Some of them do not even own a pair of shoes. These \nare the children who have never been to school since they \nhave been abandoned by their parents. They are the ones \nwho use the pavement for their pillows and the sky for a roof \nover their heads. They have no real home life and are crying \nout for help. Who will help them?

However, \nthe cheetah usually chases its prey at only about half that speed. After a chase, \na cheetah needs half an hour to catch its breath before it can eat. Because of \ntheir size, strength and predatory skills, cheetahs are considered one of the 'big \ncats'. Tigers, lions, leopards, jaguars and cougars are also part of this grouping. \nThe cheetah is hard to see because its spotted coat blends with the tall, dry \ngrass of the plains. Its excellent eyesight helps it find prey during the day. Once \nthe cheetah spots its prey it makes a lightning dash. It knocks its prey to the \nground and then bites its throat. Cheetahs eat small to medium-sized animals, \nsuch as hares, impalas, wild beast calves and gazelles. \nCheetahs today are racing towards extinction. Loss of habitat and declining \nnumbers of their prey combine to threaten the future of these cats. \n\nAdapted from https://kia's.nationalgeographic.com/animals/ cheetah/ \n#ww-wild-cats-cheetahs.jpg.
